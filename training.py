# A function to load in a video (.mp4 format, 720 by 1280 in size) from file.
# Each frame of the video will be converted to an image that can be processed.
# 
# In order to make the process (marginally) less memory-intensive, we downscale the image to
# a size of 144 pixels by 256 pixels. In addition, because the images are originally in RGB color,
# we convert to gray-scale. This also reduces the amount of memory, and while some useful information
# may be lost, the color variations from scene to scene (or dashcam to dashcam) are less important.
# Further, losing the color dimension turns a 5-D problem into a 4-D problem -- a bit more tractable.

"""HRNNs can learn across multiple levels of temporal hiearchy over a complex sequence.
Usually, the first recurrent layer of an HRNN encodes a time-dependent video (e.g. set of images)
into a vector. The second recurrent layer then encodes those vectors (encoded by the first layer) into a second layer.

The first LSTM layer first encodes every column of pixels of shape (240, 1) to a column vector of shape (128,).
The second LSTM layer encodes then these 240 column vectors of shape (240, 128) to a image vector representing the whole image. 
A final Dense layer is added for prediction.
